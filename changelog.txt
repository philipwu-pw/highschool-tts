- output device selection had a glitch, so fixed the combobox for it
- patched the combobox to register updates to the input/output device list when a new device is inserted

- shortcuts -> dictionary button
- customize slider tooltip
- when moving out of widget, change focus to mainwindow
- fix textedit scrollbar size
- fix eventfilter exceptions -> declare all event filter install at once
- dict changed needs to update mainwindow personal dict

- pause button (it gotta work)
- detect timestamps of speech
- rig up basic text-to-speech for now
- color schemes
- keybind for focusing window
- select voice
- slang dictionary
